# PetTouch Technical Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
PetTouch is a comprehensive pet management and e-commerce platform built to provide users with seamless pet profile management, NFC tag integration, and an online store experience. The project leverages modern web technologies and a robust backend to deliver a scalable and secure solution.

### Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui
- Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL), with extensive use of Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Deployment & Development: Lovable platform, Node.js, npm

---

## 2. Architecture Overview

### Frontend Structure
- Built with React and TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Uses Vite for fast development and build tooling
- Tailwind CSS and shadcn-ui for UI styling and components
- Organized into components, pages, hooks, contexts, and utilities following best practices

### Backend and Database
- Supabase as backend-as-a-service providing authentication, database, and storage
- PostgreSQL database with a consolidated schema supporting core features and e-commerce
- Extensive use of RLS policies to enforce data access control per user roles
- Storage buckets for pet images and subscription uploads

---

## 3. Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `users`: User accounts and authentication data
- `pets`: Pet profiles including medical info, emergency contacts, and metadata
- `nfc_tags`: NFC tag management linked to pets and users
- `nfc_scans`: Tracking NFC tag scans

### E-commerce System
- `products`, `store_orders`, `order_items`, `store_categories`, `store_reviews`, `store_wishlist`, `store_coupons`
- Supports product catalog, order management, reviews, wishlists, and discount coupons

### Subscription System
- `subscription_plans`, `subscription_requests`, `subscription_history`
- Manages user subscription tiers and upgrade requests

### Additional Features
- Lost & found posts, pet care tips, admin notifications, legacy customer data

### Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies ensure users access only their data
- Admins have full access; public data accessible anonymously where appropriate

## 4. Current Technical Challenges

### Audit Summary (December 2024)
- 0% schema compliance across all audited frontend pages
- 47 critical violations including field name mismatches, data type errors, missing validations, and foreign key errors
- Critical failures in e-commerce order processing, pet management, NFC tag system, and user dashboard
- Business impact includes revenue loss risk, data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and scalability issues

### Immediate Risks
- Data loss and corruption
- System downtime and failed transactions
- Security breaches due to improper validation

---

## 5. Remediation Plan

### Priority 1 - Critical Fixes (Immediate)
- Fix Checkout.tsx order processing violations (field mappings, JSONB structure, validations)
- Correct Dashboard.tsx table references and foreign key validations
- Update MyPets.tsx to use schema-compliant interfaces and JSONB handling
- Fix TagsManagement.tsx status values and foreign key constraints
- Correct Store.tsx table names and NUMERIC field handling

### Priority 2 - High Importance
- Standardize TypeScript interfaces to match database schema exactly
- Add validation functions for pets, orders, and other entities
- Implement proper error handling and constraint validations

### Priority 3 - Medium Importance
- Standardize TIMESTAMPTZ handling across the codebase
- Add comprehensive JSONB validation utilities
- Create automated tests for schema compliance and integration

---

## 6. Team and Infrastructure Requirements

### Development Team
- 2-3 Senior Developers for immediate fixes and ongoing remediation
- 1 Database Specialist for schema validation and RLS policy enforcement
- 1 QA Engineer for testing and validation

### Infrastructure
- Staging environment for testing fixes before production deployment
- Database backup and rollback procedures
- Monitoring tools for error tracking and performance
- Updated CI/CD pipeline with automated schema validation

---

## 7. Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risks
- Data loss and corruption impacting user trust and business operations
- System downtime causing revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction
- Security vulnerabilities exposing sensitive data

### Mitigation Strategies
- Immediate halt on production deployments until critical fixes are applied
- Comprehensive testing and validation before deployment
- Continuous monitoring and alerting for database errors and anomalies

---

## 8. Success Metrics and Monitoring

- Achieve 100% schema compliance across all frontend pages
- Zero critical violations in production environment
- Automated validation integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Comprehensive test coverage exceeding 90%
- Database error rate below 0.1%
- Maintain or improve query performance and user experience

---

## 9. Conclusion and Next Steps

PetTouch currently faces critical technical challenges that threaten data integrity, system stability, and business continuity. Immediate action is required to remediate schema compliance issues and stabilize the platform.

Next steps:
- Implement Priority 1 fixes within 48 hours
- Conduct thorough testing and validation
- Progress through Priority 2 and 3 remediation phases
- Establish ongoing monitoring and quality assurance processes

This PRD serves as a technical blueprint to guide the remediation and future development efforts ensuring a robust, secure, and scalable PetTouch platform.
