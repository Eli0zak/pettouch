   - Added code to ensure database schema is consistent with the actual table structure

## Tables Removed

1. **email_notifications**
   - This table was intended to store email notification records but has been completely removed

## Database Triggers Removed

1. **order_status_change_trigger** on store_orders table
   - Trigger that was firing the `notify_order_status_change()` function

2. **order_status_update_trigger** on store_orders table
   - Trigger that was firing the `notify_order_status_update()` function

## Functions Removed

1. **notify_order_status_change()**
   - Function likely responsible for sending email notifications when order status changes

2. **notify_order_status_update()**
   - Function likely responsible for sending email notifications when order status is updated

## Impact on Functionality

The removal of email notification code has the following impacts:

1. The application will no longer attempt to send email notifications for order status changes
2. The application will no longer store email notification records in the database
3. Admin notifications will still work, but will only be stored in the database (not emailed)
4. User notification preferences no longer include email options
5. Order status changes will no longer trigger email notification functions

These changes should resolve the 404 errors and "relation does not exist" errors related to email notifications while maintaining the core functionality of the application.
