# Responsive Design Optimization for PetTouch Webapp

## Overview

This update enhances the website's responsive design and accessibility by optimizing CSS and related JavaScript for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The focus is on a mobile-first approach, touch-friendly elements, and responsive images.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navbar Component (src/components/Navbar.tsx)

- Added minimum touch target sizes (`min-h-[44px]` and `min-w-[44px]`) to all interactive elements such as buttons and links.
- Ensured consistent padding and sizing using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Maintained existing responsive behavior using Tailwind's `md:` breakpoint utilities.
- Improved accessibility by ensuring touch targets meet WCAG guidelines.

### 2. Global Styles (src/styles/globals.css)

- Added mobile-first responsive container padding:
  - Mobile: 1rem padding on left and right.
  - Tablet (≥768px): 2rem padding.
  - Desktop (≥1024px): 3rem padding.
- Enforced minimum touch target sizes globally for all buttons and links.
- Made images and picture elements fluid and responsive with `max-width: 100%` and `height: auto`.
- Preserved existing color variables, dark mode support, and base styles.

## How to Implement

- The Navbar component uses Tailwind CSS classes for responsive layout and touch targets.
- Global styles are extended in `src/styles/globals.css` with custom media queries and utility styles.
- No changes to HTML structure or backend logic were made.
- The mobile menu toggle is implemented with React state and the Sheet component, requiring no additional JavaScript changes.

## Testing

- Test responsiveness using Chrome DevTools responsive mode and real devices/emulators.
- Verify no horizontal scrolling or layout breaks on screen widths: 360px, 768px, 1024px, 1920px.
- Confirm touch targets are at least 44x44 pixels.
- Validate accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers.
- Ensure images load responsively and use lazy loading where applicable.

## Summary

These changes improve the user experience across all devices by ensuring a seamless, visually appealing, and accessible interface without rebuilding the entire application.
